# gpx2maps
 I want to create a new public github repo for finding/scraping GPX routes and convert them to Google Maps (routes). Initial plan is to go for walking routes in Malmedy, Belgium, and I intend to go walking in 2 hours, so I have a very tight schedule for this app. Take all shortcuts needed, e.g. manual or agentic download over programmatic searches.
